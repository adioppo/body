			<p id="p_scrolabil_id">The human body is a complex and fascinating biological machine that is visible to the naked eye. The human body is made up of various parts that work together to ensure that the body functions properly. When we look at the human body, we can see the external parts such as the head, arms, legs, and torso.

Starting with the head, we can see the face, which is the most recognizable feature of the human body. The face consists of various parts such as the eyes, nose, ears, and mouth. The eyes are the most prominent feature, and they are responsible for vision. The nose is located between the eyes and is responsible for smelling. The mouth, on the other hand, is located below the nose and is used for eating and speaking.

Moving down from the head, we can see the torso, which includes the chest and abdomen. The chest is home to the heart and lungs, which are responsible for pumping blood and breathing, respectively. The abdomen contains various organs such as the liver, stomach, and intestines, which are responsible for digestion.

The arms and legs are attached to the torso, and they are used for movement. The arms are used for reaching and grasping, while the legs are used for walking and running. The hands and feet are located at the end of the arms and legs, respectively, and they are used for grasping and balance.

When we look at the human body, we can also see the skin, which is the largest organ in the body. The skin covers the entire body and protects it from external factors such as bacteria and UV radiation. It also regulates body temperature and allows us to feel sensations such as touch, pressure, and pain.

In conclusion, the human body is a remarkable biological machine that can be seen with the naked eye. Its various parts work together to ensure that the body functions properly. When we look at the human body, we can see its external features such as the head, arms, legs, and torso, as well as the skin that covers it.</p>
